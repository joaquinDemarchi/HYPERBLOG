Mi life 

The proyect "my life" will have four parts: my birth, my childhood, my 
adolescence and finally my day to day. Each stage will be represented 
with a different commit in Git.

First stage. I was born on Wednesday, December 17, 1997 in the Chaco 
sanatorium, with only two kilograms, it was a very small baby that was 
supposed to have many problems in childhood.

Second stage. In my childhood I was a very curious and naughty little 
boy. From what they told me he was very distracted and introverted. I 
got in trouble all the time. He was happy with very little.
